\label{Abstract}

While rigid body collision detection has been well studied, the case of deformable objects is still a topic and poses additional challenges. This paper presents some research avenues for deformable body collision detection. Different approaches based on uniform and hierarchical space partitioning or distance fields are discussed. The applicability of these methods varies in multiple areas, and their advantages and disadvantages are presented. Some of these areas include discrete/continuous collision detection, off-line/on-line simulation, object topology change, and the handling of self-collisions.
