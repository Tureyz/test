\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

This paper surveyed different strategies for collision detection of deformable objects. A semi-elastic mass-spring model built from the triangular mesh of an object, which is used to represent deformable cloth and aid in collision handling/response, has been explained. The elementary triangle overlap tests are only of two types: vertex-face and edge-edge, for a total of 15 tests to determine if two triangles intersect. Bounding Volume Hierarchies have been discussed, as they have been the subject of ample research. There are many possible implementations, which differ in the choice of bounding volume, construction, update/refitting, and what is stored at the leaf nodes. The concept of Representative Triangles can be used in combination with BVHs in order to further prune unnecessary primitive tests. RTs are built from a normal triangular mesh, and assign features (vertices, edges or faces) to incident triangles, and are then structured in a hierarchy. A different approach to collision detection using Signed Distance Fields has been presented. Most methods in this class are suited for off-line applications, but these distance fields can be used for more than intersection, such as ray casting and motion planning. A SDF implementation that works in interactive environments, for detecting collision of deformable objects against rigid objects, is discussed. A robust and efficient spatial hashing based collision detection method is explained, having various parameters that can be tweaked according to the simulation in order to achieve better performance. Adaptations of well known structures (normal cones) and properties to continuous collision detection are presented.

\section{Further Work}
\label{section:further}

Collision detection in real-time applications presents interest. The objective of future research is a robust intersection method that makes use of the advanced graphics hardware in present times, taking advantage of their massive parallel capabilities, focusing on highly interactive environments and consumer-level technology. Continuous collision detection is preferred, as it is the "cleaner" and more modular approach: in the case of discrete collision detection, the response module must unrealistically transpose vertices in order to avoid inter-penetration and preserve realism. Further research into bounding volume hierarchies and the combination of these structures with other strategies will be done.
